STRUCTURAL PRESERVATION REQUIREMENTS:

- Maintain all node positions, connections, and directional flow from the reference image.
- Reproduce every text label EXACTLY as shown -- spelling, capitalization, and content must match.
- Preserve the directed/undirected nature of all edges.
- Enhance the visual presentation (colors, shapes, textures, lighting) without altering the structure.
- Node shapes may be stylized to match the aesthetic but must remain visually distinct and readable."""
